# Make Task

## What's a 'Make' Task?

In these tasks you have to use the skills learned in the previous exercises to create a new program based on the requirements below.

You are going to be practicing 
- variables
- input
- output.

## Task Instructions

Lots of websites use chatbots to interact with their customers.  These chatbots are often very sophisticated and use AI to learn and adapt to the user.  Our chat bot is going to be much, much simpler.
 
The chatbot should work like this:
 
- Ask the user their name and store it in a variable.
- Greet the user by name.
- Ask the user three questions about themselves and store their responses in three different, suitably named variables.
- At least one of the questions should take a number (`float` or `int`) as an answer.
- Respond to each of the questions one by one, using the userâ€™s name and their answer in the response.
- For the question with a number, perform math on the number and use the answer in your response.
- Like in the example below, sometimes the responses may not make perfect sense. That is fine. 
- The example below is just an example! You can ask your own questions and create your own responses. Have fun with it!


## Example Run With Both Prompts and Responses (Responses in Red)

What is your name? `Mr. Mac Donald`

Hello Mr. Mac Donald!

How many pets do you have? `one`

Mr. Mac Donald, I bet you enjoy having one pets!

How many hours of sleep do you usually get (enter a number)? `9`

Mr. Mac Donald, doctors say you should get 8 hours of sleep. You are getting 9 hours and missing -1 hours of sleep.

## Help! My Code Doesn't Work!

Make sure that you check for the following things:

- You have put the parenthesis after the input command `()`
- You have typed the variable name **exactly** the same (including caps), every time
- There is a variable on the **left** of each assignment
- You have used a single **=** for assignment
- You have used the **+** symbol to concatenate (join).
- All of your indentation is correct.
- You concatenated numbers using `str(number)`
- You remembered to convert the `input` using `int()` or `float()`
